# DrJava
A doctor terminal app to help diagnose medical conditions and prescribes treament given the patient's symptoms. Run the code [here](https://replit.com/@WinstonHo/DrJava).

Uses the Maven package manager with [this JSON package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) and [this medical API](https://rapidapi.com/priaid/api/symptom-checker/) to diagnose symptoms and diagnose potential illnesses or diseases the patient may have.


Poverty makes people unable to get medical help. When someone needs access to medical help but can’t get it, their health starts to deteriorate and may affect other aspects of their life such as their income and ability to support their family members and close friends. This leads to an endless cycle where the person needs good health to maintain a stable income, but needs a stable income to seek medical help. This results in people being stuck in poverty and being unable to climb out of poverty. 


“When health care is needed but is delayed or not obtained, people's health worsens, which in turn leads to lost income and higher health care costs, both of which contribute to poverty”.

Needing a good income to receive health care is especially important if it is expensive (like in the US) or if it is not easily accessible (like in many third world countries).


My program addresses the problem by allowing people to simply input their symptoms to get potential illnesses they may have and possible treatments to those illnesses. It is more easily accessible compared to traditional health care as it is free and requires no documents to verify the user. Giving people the ability to diagnose themselves is a huge advantage, as it gives the user the ability to treat minor health problems and the ability to mitigate major health problems so that they can gain an advantage to lift themselves out of poverty.
